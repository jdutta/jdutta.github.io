For some time the [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) project drew my attention.
Had the chance to really check it out today. After figuring out exactly what
it is for, it was very exciting to set up for jdutta.github.io. I use wordpress for my personal blog,
which is probably fine for
its purpose, but I have been leaning towards a tech blog which could be updated by pushing to git.
So far a clean solution seems to be github pages powered by jekyll. For the theme, I chose
Zack Holman's [Left](https://github.com/holman/left).

I also set up my a new repository [d3viz](https://github.com/jdutta/d3viz) to develop and play with custom d3
visualizations. Given the choices, deciding where to host the demo pages is always a headache. One option
is to use a github page for the d3viz repository, but then it would mean copying code from master branch to the
orphan gh-pages branch. I was
almost going that way when I found what Mike Bostock's [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/) offers. It is
a convenient mechanism to host an index.html, complete with code highlighting, by putting it in a gist
in github. I am giving it a shot. The demo links are available in the [d3viz wiki](https://github.com/jdutta/d3viz/wiki).
