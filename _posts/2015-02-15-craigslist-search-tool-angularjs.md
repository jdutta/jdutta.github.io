title: Craigslist multi-site search tool using AngularJS
category: posts

I didn't think I would come back to riding a motorcycle just yet. But the inevitable happened.
Wife wanted me to rent a motorcycle for a weeklong trip. The rental cost didn't seem cheap enough,
so I started a casual search of used models in craigslist. Soon it became a headache because
I could use the same query in multiple CL sites and I actually wanted to buy it from far so we
could have a fly-and-ride adventure.

I ended up making a quick AngularJS app to use the same query in multiple CL sites and show them together.

I hope this will prove useful to many.
