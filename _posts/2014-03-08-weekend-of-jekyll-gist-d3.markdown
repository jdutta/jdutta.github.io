title: Weekend of jekyll, gist and d3
category: posts

Today was a productive Sunday. For some time the jekyll project drew my attention. After figuring exactly what
it does, it was very exciting to set it up. I use wordpress for my personal blog, which is probably fine for
its purpose, but I wanted a personal tech blog which could be updated by pushing to git. So far a great solution
seems to be github pages powered by jekyll.

I also set up my a new repository [d3viz](https://github.com/jdutta/d3viz) to develop and play with custom d3
visualization. One big headache was figuring out how to host a simple demo page for each visualization. One option
is to use a github page for the d3viz repository, but then it would mean copying code from master branch to the
orphan gh-pages branch. I was
almost going that way when I figured what Mike Bostock's [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/) offers. It is
a very convenient mechanism to host a simple index.html, complete with code highlighting. I am giving it a shot.
The demo links are available in the [d3viz wiki](https://github.com/jdutta/d3viz/wiki).
