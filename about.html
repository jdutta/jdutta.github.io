    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        I am working at Blue Coat Systems as a Principal engineer. My specialty is the frontend stack, integration of UI
        with API,
        and dealing with the display of large volumes of data in various forms. I write custom SVG visualizations in
        D3.js
        and also experiment with 3D and VR using THREE.js. I also mentor a team of junior devs to write better code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside work, I am a Hang Glider pilot, motorcyclist, tinkerer, photographer and an outdoor enthusiast in general.
