title: About
---

I am working at Symantec as a Principal engineer. My specialty is the frontend stack, integration of UI with API, and dealing with the display of large volumes of data in various forms. I write custom SVG visualizations in D3.js and also experiment with 3D and VR using THREE.js. I also mentor a team of junior devs to write better code.

Outside work, I am a Hang Glider pilot, motorcyclist, tinkerer, photographer and an outdoor enthusiast in general.

Sole purpose of this website is to share technical projects and knowhow.
